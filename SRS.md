## 1. Introduction

The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Personal Finance Management System. It serves as a blueprint for the development team and stakeholders to understand the system's functionalities, constraints, and performance expectations.

## 2. Software Fundamentals

### Definition of Requirements
Requirements represent the needs or constraints placed upon a software product.

### Product and Requirements
The product refers to the Personal Finance Management System, while requirements define its features, behaviors, and constraints.

### Functional and Nonfunctional Requirements
Functional requirements describe what the system should do, while non-functional requirements specify how the system should perform.

### Emergent Properties
Emergent properties are characteristics of the system that arise from the interaction of its components.

### Quantifiable Requirements
Requirements that can be measured or quantified, such as response time, reliability, and scalability.

### System Requirements and Software Requirements
System requirements define the capabilities and constraints of the entire system, while software requirements specify the behavior and features of the software component.

## 3. Requirements Process

### Process Models
Various process models such as Waterfall, Agile, and Spiral can be utilized for requirements elicitation, analysis, and validation.

### Process Actors
Actors involved in the requirements process include stakeholders, developers, testers, and project managers.

### Process Support and Management
Tools and techniques used to support and manage the requirements process, including requirement management software and version control systems.

### Process Quality and Improvement
Continuous improvement of the requirements process through feedback, reviews, and lessons learned.

## 4. Requirement Elicitation

### Requirement Sources
Sources of requirements include stakeholders, domain experts, market research, and existing systems.

### Elicitation Techniques
Techniques such as interviews, surveys, brainstorming sessions, and use cases can be employed to elicit requirements effectively.

## 5. Requirement Analysis

### Requirement Classification
Requirements can be classified as functional, non-functional, user, system, and software requirements.

### Conceptual Modeling
Creating models such as use case diagrams, activity diagrams, and class diagrams to understand and represent requirements.

### Architectural Design and Requirements Allocation
Allocating requirements to system components and defining the system architecture based on functional and non-functional requirements.

### Requirements Negotiations
Resolving conflicts and prioritizing requirements through negotiation with stakeholders.

### Formal Analysis
Using formal methods such as formal specification languages and model checking to analyze and validate requirements rigorously.

## 6. Requirement Specifications

### System Definition Document
A high-level document that defines the purpose, scope, and stakeholders of the system.

### System Requirement Specification
Detailed requirements specifying the functionalities, constraints, and interfaces of the system.

### Software Requirement Specification
A detailed document specifying the software component's requirements, including user interface design, database structure, and system behavior.

## 7. Requirement Validations

### Requirements Reviews
Conducting reviews with stakeholders to ensure that requirements are clear, complete, and consistent.

### Prototyping
Building prototypes to demonstrate system functionalities and gather feedback from stakeholders.

### Model Validation
Validating requirement models through simulation, testing, and analysis.

### Acceptance Tests
Performing acceptance tests to verify that the system meets the specified requirements and satisfies stakeholders' needs.

## 8. Practical Considerations

### Iterative Nature of the Requirements Process
Recognizing that requirements are subject to change and refining them iteratively throughout the software development lifecycle.

### Change Management
Establishing processes to manage and track changes to requirements effectively.

### Requirements Attributes
Assigning attributes such as priority, stability, and traceability to requirements to facilitate management and tracking.

### Measuring Requirements
Defining metrics to measure the quality, completeness, and consistency of requirements.

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

Non-Functional Requirements specify the criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors. 

- **Performance**: The system should respond to user requests within 2 seconds under normal load conditions.
- **Reliability**: The system should have an uptime of at least 99.9%.
- **Security**: User data should be encrypted during transmission and storage to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, with clear navigation and instructions.
- **Scalability**: The system should be able to handle a minimum of 1000 concurrent users without degradation in performance.
- **Maintainability**: The system code should be well-documented and modular to facilitate future maintenance and enhancements.
