## 5. Approach
- **Functional Testing**: Validate each feature against the functional requirements.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure all components interact correctly.
- **Regression Testing**: Re-test after changes to ensure no new defects.
- **Usability Testing**: Ensure the system is user-friendly and meets user expectations.
- **Automated Testing**: Use automated tools for repetitive testing tasks.
 
## 6. Item Pass/Fail Criteria
- A test case is considered passed if the actual results match the expected results.
- A test case is considered failed if the actual results do not match the expected results or if there are any unexpected errors.
 
## 7. Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements
- **Suspension Criteria**: Testing will be suspended if critical defects are found that block further testing.
- **Resumption Requirements**: Testing will resume once the blocking defects are resolved and verified.
